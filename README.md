# AutoTranslateSpeech
  <h3>autoTranslateSpeech.py</h3>
    - This program uses drop down menus that allows the user to select a language to translate from and to.<br>
    - The program then will listen for speech when the translate button is pressed.<br>
    - After the user is finished speaking the program will take the audio, translate it, then present it as text on screen.<br>
    - The program also "Speaks" back the translated phrase to the user(s).<br>
    <br>
    - Supported Languages: English, Spanish, Hindi, French, German, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, Korean<br>
    <br>
    - Microphone Needed!<br>
    - This program may still have issues and is a work in progress.<br>
    - Working on adding an auto-detect function so that if the language is unknown it will still translate it for the user.<br>
    - I am also working on a Java version of this application as well.<br>
